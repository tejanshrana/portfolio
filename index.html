                <h2>Who am I and what do I?</h2>
                <p>Hello ðŸ‘‹</p>
                <p>My name is Tejansh Rana and I am a Mechanical Engineer turned into Software Engineer. I love building
                    applications. Every aspect of it. Right from the inception where the application is
                    still
                    an idea or a solution to a problem or at times, a non solution
                    to a non problem, visualizing it to be a full fledged application used by everyone on the planet, to
                    designing the
                    solution and actually building and deploying the application, I love every bit of it! Software
                    development, thus, is
                    beyond profession
                    for me, and is more of an obsession.</p>

                <p>Currently, I am working as a Tech Lead at <a href="https://www.version1.com/" target="_blank"
                        rel="noopener noreferrer">Version1</a> where my primary responsibilities are</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Solution Architecture</strong> - Designing end to end architecture, cloud infrastructure
                        design
                        with
                        AWS, deciding tech stack, and collaborating with Product Owners to translate business
                        requirements to technical solutions</li>
                    <li><strong>Fullstack development</strong> - Full stack development using Java, Springboot,
                        ReactJS, and Python. I specialize in building Cloud Native
                        applications with focus on AWS.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mentoring</strong> - Technical on boarding, helping team members up skill, mentoring
                        team members to help them reach the next level in their career path</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I obsess over
                    technologies. Not just the ones I work with but generally everything available out there. I love
                    learning about it and try it hands-on myself. This obsession extends to everything tech - cars,
                    gadgets,
                    concepts, hardware...everything. You can usually
                    find me reading, listening, or watching about it.
                </p>

                <h2>What stack do I work with?</h2>

                        alt="Sprinboot logo">
                    <p> On the backend, I prefer Java and Sprinboot to build Microservices. I have
                        been using Spring since
                        the time I started development and prefer the mature, well-rounded framework and the huge
                        community support around. Spring Cloud Netflix is yet another valuable addition to the Spring
                        ecosystem and is all the
                        more reason I
                        prefer to use Spring to build my microservices.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tech-stack">
                    <img src="https://d3o36tnwurb13j.cloudfront.net/assets/icons/React-icon.svg.png" alt="React logo">
                    <p> On the frontend, I prefer ReactJS. The flexibility to use a large number of supporting libraries
                        for various aspects for frontend development like forms, validations, testing, etc. as well as
                        the
                        modularity of every building block being it's own component feels the natural choice to me.
                        Although
                        frontend is an acquired skill for me, I can compliment it well enough to build large scale
                        enterprise applications.</p>

                    <p> I cannot talk about being cloud native without having built Serverless Applications. In fact,
                        you
                        can read more about my Serverless experience below. My language of choice for building
                        Serverless
                        Applications is Python. This general purpose language is capable of being used in every aspect
                        of
                        Software development whether it be web apps, ML, data pipelines, or Infrastructure modules. The
                        rich
                        library support as well as the versatility of the language makes it the obvious choice for
                        building
                        Serverless applications.</p>

                    <p>While building Cloud applications whether they are microservices or monoliths or Serverless
                        Applications, my preference of Cloud provider is Amazon Web Services. I am also proficient with
                        building infrastructure, full fledged cloud solutions, as well as build and deployment pipelines
                        in
                        AWS, all with Infrastructure as Code using CloudFormation. In my current role, I also look after
                        the
                        end to end security of our applications, both for the application itself and the infrastructure
                        it
                        is deployed on.</p>

                    <p>Microservices and containers go hand in hand. I am quite comfortable working with Docker and
                        prefer
                        to run it on Fargate with ECS. Not only do containers make micrservices more autonomous and
                        self-serving, scaling applications comes in extremely handy with them. For local development as
                        well, building docker containers is my go to choice since working on multiple projects while
                        managing various versions and dependency support required for each one is extremely convenient
                        when
                        they are containerized.</p>
